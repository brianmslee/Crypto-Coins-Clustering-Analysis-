# Crypto-Coins-Clustering-Analysis

## Project Description:
Through utilizing clustering algorithms such as KMeans algorithm and the elbow method for optimal cluster amount, the project serves to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The raw data was normalized. After, the elbow method was utilized to find the best value for k for the KMeans algorithm. Next, the cryptocurrencies were clustered through the KMeans algorithm. Clusters were optimized with the Principal Component Analysis. Then, the same steps were followed through with the Principal Component Analysis data.
